**Architecture**

  The basis for the much of the front end utilized the express framework. This system laid the ground work for a basic functioning web application. With the help of javascript, features and improved functionality could be later set up, improving experiance and efficiancy.
  Angular, another web framework. Was implemented to create a functional SPA in the system. Rather than using javascript, much of the functionality was created using typescript, another very similar language in much respect to JavaScript.

  MongoDB, a nosql database system was used to create and store various different trips in the system. This satasfied the M in our implementation of a MEAN stack. MongoDB also uses javascript which provides an easy interface when connecting the front end to the data tier of our system.

**Functionality**

  JSON and JavaScript are utilized for interfacing between the front and back end. JavaScript provides more typical programming conventions, utilizing methods and classes. While JSON focuses only on holding data and manipulation of said data. In our use case, JSON was used to hold the trips information and JavaScript was used to obtain all the JSON information and coordinate between the front and back end.
  Handlebars was a great tool to have when refactoring code and creating a more dynamic system. Using partials to link UI elements created a seamless transition from static to dynamic HTML.

**Testing**
  In regards to testing, Postman was quite essential. Being able to test various API calls, such as GET, Put and POST. Errors and other bugs were able to be troubleshot fast using the tools provided. Obtaining the API key was another interesing method for testing the performance of the system.

**Reflection**
  Problem solving, attention to detail and simply thinking outside the box were all skills forged through out the course. Road block were encountered with every assingment, however nothing was found to be impossible through perseverence. Each module included topics and principles that provided relevent insight into future growth in my education and career as I continue to move up.
